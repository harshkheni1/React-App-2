            Telehealth involves the use of electronic communications to enable providers at
            different locations to share individual client information for the purpose of improving
            client care. Providers may include primary care practitioners, specialists, and/or
            subspecialists. The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or
            education, and may include any of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Client health records</li>
            <li>Live two-way audio and video</li>
            <li>Output data from health devices and sound and video files</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to
            protect the confidentiality of client identification and imaging data and will include
            measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or
            unintentional corruption.{' '}
